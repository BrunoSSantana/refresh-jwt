# Autentication with JWT and refresh token

This repository was created for didactic purposes, just to put into practice knowledge acquired about jwt, implementing concepts suggested in [Lucas Santos' blog](https://blog.lsantos.dev) [post](https://blog.lsantos.dev/jwt-seguro/). In addition, simple permission rules were implemented.

## Use and Installation
Project was built in nodejs with in-memory database, so to run the project it is only necessary to run `npm i` to install node dependencies and `npm start:dev` to start the application. This way the api will go up to http://localhost:3333 and it will be possible to use the documentation contained in the documentation folder of this repository, where I recommend using it with insomnia but it can be another client that implements the openAPI specification.
